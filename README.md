"Visualizing the American University" aims to provide a visual illustration of the history of universities in America, specifically in their settler-colonial investments with indigenous populations, to demonstrate how the mission of higher education institutions effectively erases indigenous people. This app works in tandem with the collaborative online project "Campus Space â€” Creating an Accessible Space for Information, Collectivity, and Creativity for the Abolitionist University Project", made by members of the Abolitionist University Studies course in Fall 2019 at Wesleyan University.
